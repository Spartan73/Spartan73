    <h1>SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION</h1>
 <section>
 <h2>How Search Engines Work</h2>
  <p>Search engines work by crawling hundreds of billions of pages using their own web crawlers. These web crawlers are commonly referred to as search engine bots or spiders. A search engine navigates the web by downloading web pages and following links on these pages to discover new pages that have been made available.</p>

 <h2>The Importance of Keywords and Descriptions as Meta Tags</h2>
  <p>Keywords, also known as Meta Tags, are snippets of code that tell search engines important information about your web page, such as how they should display it in search results. They also tell web browsers how to display it to visitors. For example, one of the very first keywords will begin with the Title Tag. Every web page has keywords, but they’re only visible in the HTML code.</p>

 <h2>The Four Elements that Comprise Writing Content Relevant Links</h2>
  <p>This list is a brief overview of four elements that expresses the importance of writing content relevant links.</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Links should bring qualified traffic to a website.</li>
    <li>Links should be strategically targeted for the audience.</li>
    <li>Links should come from authoritative pages.</li>
    <li>Links should come from topically relevant sopurces.</li>
   </ol>

<p><strong>Some additional examples of implementing good relevant linking strategies include: 
   Internal Linking, Inbound (External & Backlinks) Linking, Anchor Text and Nofollow Linking. Overall:</strong></p>

   <ul>
     <li>Good Internal Linking aids in website navigation, defines the architecture and hierarchy of the website and can properly distribute page authority and ranking throughout multiple pages of a website.</li>
     <li>The use of Anchor Text helps Google understand what the link is about such as where you are linking and what the subject matter is.</li>
     <li>Use relevant links that navigate the user to other areas of the website. For example; if the website you created is all about dress shoes and fashion trends, don’t provide a link to a website about automotive repair as the contents do not exactly corelate. Link to relevant content within your website.</li>
     <li>Use links that are natural for the user. Doing this improves the overall user engagement and experience while navigating the website.</li>
   </ul>

 <h2>Good Heading Hierarchy</h2>
  <p>Headings should be logically structured on a page from biggest in text (most important) to smallest in text (least important). A page starts with the H1 heading, followed by an H2 heading and — should you need another sub-section — it can be followed by an H3 heading. If you need more sub-sections, you can even add H4-H6 subheadings. Again, from most important to least, top to bottom.</p>

 <h3>Hierarchy Examples</h3>
   <ol>
    <li>h1 - A large heading should be short but describe the page's main topic</li>
    <li>h2 - Smaller subheadings describes a sub-category of information to follow</li>
    <li>h3 - An even-smaller subheading describes additional content and so on...</li>
   </ol>

<button onclick="topFunction()" id="myBtn" title="Go to top">To The Top</button>

<script>
    //Get the button
    var mybutton = document.getElementById("myBtn");

    // When the user scrolls down 20px from the top of the document, show the button
    window.onscroll = function() {scrollFunction()};

    function scrollFunction() {
    if (document.body.scrollTop > 20 || document.documentElement.scrollTop > 20) {
        mybutton.style.display = "block";
    } else {
        mybutton.style.display = "none";
    }
    }

    // When the user clicks on the button, scroll to the top of the document
    function topFunction() {
    document.body.scrollTop = 0;
    document.documentElement.scrollTop = 0;
    }
</script>
